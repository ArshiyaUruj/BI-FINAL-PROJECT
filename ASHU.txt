An ex-NDA cadet.|||Educator at Unacademy.|||Ashutosh Trivedi - Unacademy|||Fitness freak.|||DUite.|||Came out from womb on 30th June.|||QuorAddict.|||Reader / Writer.|||Love to ride, travel and explore.|||Tall guy (6.1″)|||Will the GOI sell RBI as well after LIC? Is my dream of working for a high paying PSU at the start of my career wasted and do I have to start at low paying private sector jobs under stingy Indian private sector employers?RBI is not a PSU. It is a central bank.Every country needs a central bank to look after the supervision of the banks and track the overall well-being of the nation's economy.So, the concept of selling RBI is out of question.As far as other PSUs are concerned, it's my personal opinion that if 75% of the nation's citizens fall under Below Poverty Line, we can't go towards reckless privatisation which is good for a developed nation.|||Is preparing for the IIT better than the Air Force or the NDA?It all depends what you want to be in future.If you're passionate for the Forces and want to serve country by leading from the front, go for NDA, AFCAT etc.If you want to be an engineer and contribute towards scientific innovations, go for IITs.It all sums up to a decision of yours, regarding what you want to be in future.|||Should I leave my mother for studying in DU?There is nothing like leaving your mother. You just have to move out to pursue a course of your choice which in turn may bring a bright future for you.Initially​ you may find a big cultural difference in the crowd as compared to your own. But with time , once you make friends you'll enjoy studying here.Infact DU has got people from all over the country. So there is a blend of varied cultural differences. This is indeed a beauty you'll see here.Besides, there are a lot of PGs available everywhere in Delhi, so accomodation won't be a problem. Connectivity throughout Delhi is awesome because of Metro.So I would suggest you to definitely move out as the value of DU is obviously greater than that of any local college.Hope this clears your query.PS : If you still have any doubt , you can directly message me (on Quora itself).
