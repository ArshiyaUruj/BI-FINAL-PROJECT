The pandemic has magnified the financial insecurity of too many American families, the deep and real racial disparities in our society – and the imbalanced burdens on working moms. We have to create something better for America on the other side of this. ||| In moments of crisis,we look out for one other. And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. @JoeBiden has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery. ||| Parents, you deserve a break – Michelle’s got storytime handled every Monday. She’s one of the best, I promise. (And I confess it makes me a little nostalgic.) |||When I think of people I’ve counted on over the years, Sarah Hurwitz comes to mind. She&#39;s the talented author of @HereAllAlong , and a longtime member of my team. Here she shares her experience with faith, traditions, and staying connected during this time. ||| We can&#39;t deny that racial and socioeconomic factors are playing a role in who is being hit the hardest by the virus. It&#39;s a reminder for our policymakers to keep our most vulnerable communities at the forefront when making decisions. ||| Sometimes it takes the wisdom and resilience of those who have been marginalized for all of us to remember the importance of community and mutual aid.| | | The best part of my job was meeting people like this—ready to make a selfless act in a time of need. Many Americans are already making deep sacrifices to keep our communities healthy, but if you’re able to, consider helping those hit the hardest.
